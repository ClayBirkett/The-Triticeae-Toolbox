  - Apache
  - MySQL
  - PHP, including PEAR
  - Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer.  Can be installed with this command:
    % sudo pear install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-0.9.2
- For some functions
  - for ViroBLAST.  
    - DBD:CSV. Can be installed with this command:
      % sudo cpan DBD::CSV
    - NCBI BLAST+, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
      Edit viroblast/viroblast.ini to use the path to these executables.

  - PHP-libgd (?)

<b>Setting up the MySQL databases</b>
Load the schema and some initializing data from the .sql files in this docs/ directory.
mysql> create database T3wheat;
mysql> use T3wheat;
mysql> source T3wheat_schema.sql;
mysql> source T3wheat_skeleton.sql;

Grant read-permission (only) to a user such as "publicuser".

mysql> grant select on T3wheat.* to publicuser@localhost identified by '&lt;password>';
mysql> grant update, insert, delete on T3wheat.session_variables to publicuser@localhost;
mysql> grant execute on T3wheat.* to publicuser@localhost;

Grant write permission to another user such as "curator":

mysql> grant all on T3wheat.* to curator@localhost identified by '&lt;password>';

Similarly, create the GBrowse database "gtht" and grant permissions.

mysql> create database gtht;
mysql> grant select on gtht.* to publicuser@localhost identified by '&lt;password>';

<b>Database connection scripts</b>
For security, the password information to connect to the MySQL database
is not stored within the T3 source code repository or even within the
Apache directory.  For example ours is in
/data/tht_data/mysql_connections/.  The file permissions need only allow
read access for the Apache user, e.g.  www-data:

-r-------- 1 www-data www-data 196 2011-01-31 11:56 T3wheat_readonly.inc
-r-------- 1 www-data www-data 141 2011-01-31 11:56 T3wheat_writeaccess.inc

Create these files with the contents shown below, and edit your files
includes/bootstrap.inc and includes/bootstrap_curator.inc to point to the
correct pathname for your system.

T3wheat_readonly.inc:
&lt;?php
  $db_config = array('db_name' => 'T3wheat',
                     'db_user' => 'publicuser',
                     'db_pass' => '&lt;password>',
                     'db_host' => 'localhost');
?>

T3wheat_writeaccess.inc:
&lt;?php
  $db_config = array('db_name' => 'T3wheat',
                     'db_user' => 'curator',
                     'db_pass' => '&lt;password>',
                     'db_host' => 'localhost');
?>

<b>cron jobs</b>
Some pages use "materialized view" tables of allele data rather than the
source table 'alleles' itself.  Some of these view tables are created
and updated from the source table with scripts in the cron/ directory.
These scripts can be executed automatically using crontab entries like
this:

0 3 * * * &lt;root_dir>/cron/&lt;script>


<b>Directories for uploaded and output files</b>
Uploaded data files are stored in the curator_data/uploads/ directory,
which must be writable by the Apache user, e.g. www-data.  

% cd curator_data
% mkdir uploads
% sudo chown www-data uploads

Likewise, certain "raw" data files that are not parsed into the database
are archived in the raw/ directory, so this must be writable by the 
Apache user too.

All output and temporary files are stored in directory /tmp/tht/, where
write-access for the scripts isn't a problem and they're all in one
place to be purged daily or hourly with a cron() job.  In order for this
to work there must be a symbolic link from somewhere in the webserver's
documents directory to /tmp/tht.  For example if your T3 repositories
are in a subdirectory "t3" of the webserver's top directory
"/www/htdocs", this would make the link:

% cd /www/htdocs/t3; mkdir tmp; ln -s /tmp/tht tmp/tht

<b>PHP configuration</b>
Some helpful modifications for the php.ini file, such as 
/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini:

max_input_time = 600
memory_limit = 512M
post_max_size = 100M
upload_max_filesize = 100M
error_log = /var/log/php-scripts.log

For logging from PHP, set the owner of the log file to the Apache user,
e.g. www-data
# touch /var/log/php-scripts.log
# chown www-data /var/log/php-scripts.log

Then restart the Apache server to read the new php.ini configuration.

<b>GBrowse</b>

Installing GBrowse should have created a gbrowse.conf/ directory in the
Apache configuration directory, e.g. in /etc/apache2/.  Edit the
tht.conf file in the repository's gbrowse-generated/ directory to
replace "&lt;password>" with the publicuser password you assigned for
the gtht database above, and move tht.conf to the gbrowse.conf/
directory.

Add the following stanza to your Apache configuration file, e.g.
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default, and restart Apache.

Alias /perl/ "/cgi-bin/"
&lt;Location /perl/>
     SetHandler perl-script
     PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
     PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
     Options +ExecCGI
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
&lt;/Location>
