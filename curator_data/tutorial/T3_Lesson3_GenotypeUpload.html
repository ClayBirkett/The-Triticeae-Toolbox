<h4>This tutorial will guide a curator/user in preparing the necessary files to upload results from a genotyping experiment to T3.  <p>Any <a href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/t3/wheat/feedback.php">feedback</a> is welcome!  </h4>
<hr>

<h4>Section One.  Validate Germplasm Line Names in The Triticeae Toolbox (T3)</h4>
<p>

As you learned in Lesson One, before uploading data the line names have to exist in T3. 
<p>
<b>Click</b> 'Lines' from the top menu bar and 'Select Lines by Properties' from the dropdown menu.  (Figure 1.1)</p><p>
<b>Enter</b> line names in the 'Name' text box.  A list can also be pasted in from an Excel column, text file, etc. (Figure 1.2) 
</p><p>
If the lines records exist in T3, a report will be generated on the lower section on the page. (Figure 1.3)
<br>
If germplasm lines are not on T3, like the example lines Karma and Dogma, error messages are generated.

Note that Steptoe and Morex are in T3, Karma and Dogma are not found and will require a line input file before T3 will accept experimental data for those lines.

<h4>Section Two. Download Templates / Example Files  </h4>
<p>
Click the 'Data Submission' button on the T3 homepage (Figure 2.1).  This takes the user to the Participant's Page (Figure 2.2).  For genotype data file examples, select three files:
<ul>
<li>Experiment Annotation (Figure 2.3)</li>
<li>Line Translation (Figure 2.4)</li> 
<li>Experiment Results, 1D or 2D (Figure 2.5)</li>
</ul>

All fields are required.

<p>
<b>Figure 2.2.  Example of a genotype experiment trialcode file.</b><br>
This is simply two columns, the first with the line name, the second with the trial code.  Trial codes are somewhat flexible and typically consist of the "ExptYear_Location_Description".  For example, CAPV2011_MN_9K.

<p>
<b>Figure 2.3.  Example of a genotype experiment 2D results file.</b><br>
Place markers in Column A and Line Names as column headers.  Note that when a spreadsheet is saved to a tab-delimited file these will no longer align.

<h4>Section Three.  Test Upload on the T3 Sandbox.  </h4>
<p>
Log onto the T3 Sandbox using your user login or User ID : t3user@graingenes.org and Password : t3password .
<p>
Once you are logged on, you will see three additional tabs on the top menu bar.  The data upload pages are linked to the Curation menu. (Figure 3.1)
<p>
<b>Figure 3.1.  T3 Curation Menu Dropdown</b><br>
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
Upload the annotation file for the genotype experiment first.  Select "Add Genotype Annotations" from the curation dropdown menu to retrieve the annotation upload page. (Figure 3.2)
<p>
Use the Browse button to select the file on your computer, then click the 'Upload' button.  At this time all data on the production database is public. 
<p>
<b>Figure 3.2.  Genotype Annotation File Upload Page</b><br>
<p>
<img src="images/annotation_upload1.jpg" width="1120" height="379" alt="" title="" border="0" />
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The Validation page shows you that the file will upload.  T3 also reads the three file names for raw data (manifest, cluster file and sample sheet), and gives the user the opportunity to upload those files.
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
Finally, the result page shows you that the data uploaded successfully, but we did not load the raw data.  
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
Click 'Add Genotype Results from the curation dropdown menu to get the results upload page (Figure 3.5). <br>
Use the browse buttons to select the line translation file and results file from your computer.  The default data structure is 2D.  Uploading genotype results can take up to several hours and is done offline.  Be sure the e-mail address is correct.  Once you submit the data results will be mailed.
 Fatal errors are usually reported within seconds.  A successful upload message will be mailed with a link to the data processing log. (Figure 3.6)
 <p>
Once the data loads properly, or if you have any questions, please contact Victoria Blake at victoria.blake@ars.usda.gov.
